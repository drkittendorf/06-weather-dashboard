## DESCRIPTION

This webpage **showcases** the Open Weather API and uses 2 different API calls/ keys with Open Weather. One to provide temperature and one to provide wind speed. The app stores previously searched cities, and displays.


- User is provided a weather dashboard with form input
- WHEN user searches for a city
- THEN they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN they view current weather conditions for that city
- they are presented with the city name, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- WHEN they view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN they are presented with a 5-day forecast
- WHEN they click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

For `future` development, I would like to incorporate the following `enhancements':

-Options to be added in further updates include:
  - the date, an icon representation of weather conditions,
  - WHEN I view the UV index
  - THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
  - WHEN I open the weather dashboard
  - THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
