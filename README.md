## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

For `future` development, I would like to incorporate the following `enhancements':

-Options to be added in further updates include:
the date, an icon representation of weather conditions,
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
